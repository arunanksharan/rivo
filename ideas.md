# Product Idea

1. 3D view of the property in terms of:
   - Locality
   - Drains
   - Network strength
   - Noise pollution
   - Water logging
   - AQI
   - (Think other intanglible factors a consumer may miss during property selection which may be important to them and which makes a site visit mandatory - since the user tries to physically visit and verify these)
   - Religious institutions
   - Shopping malls
   - Schools
   - Hospitals
   - Banks
   - Public transport
2. Quantifiable metrics of intangibles - "checklist of sorts" which can be scored from
3. Rental price discovery
4. Alternative data sources for price discovery - commercial properties
